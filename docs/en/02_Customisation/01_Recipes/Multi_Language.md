## Multi Language / Translated Shop

Making your shop support multiple languages is much like doing the same for any other

You can use the [Fluent](https://packagist.org/packages/tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent) or [Translatable](https://packagist.org/packages/silverstripe/translatable) Module to translate your shop.
